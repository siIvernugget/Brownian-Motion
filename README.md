## Brownian Motion and Brownian Bridge Construction

This project presents a mathematical and computational description of Brownian Motion and Brownian Bridge Construction with a focus on simulating both processes.

The project was completed as part of a university course called "Computing" focussing on creating mathematical models using R and writing in LaTeX.
